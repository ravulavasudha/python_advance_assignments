    "### Q1. What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all ?\n",
    "Ans: A probability distribution describes how a random variable is distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It tells us which values a random variable is most likely to take on and which values are less likely. Based on the previous data and the occurences of the random event, we can predict the outcome in terms of probabilities.\n"

    "Ans: : True Random Numbers are true physical values while pseudo-random numbers are generated internally by a program . Latter is considered good enough as they have sort of uniform distribution.\n"
