    "### 1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "Ans: An abstract class/superclass can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas an abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation\n"

Variables which are defined in the class body (but outside all methods) are called as class level variables or class attributes. they can be referenced by there bare names within the same scope, but they can also be accessed from outside this scope if we use the attribute access operator (.). on a class or an instance of the class."
